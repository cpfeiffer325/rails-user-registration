# RAILS USER REGISTRATION PROJECT

## DESCRIPTION
Assignment to build a user registration app that also sends notifications on registration

## CRITERIA
- Have a User Registration form requiring email and password
- When a User registers themselves, perform two side effects:
  - Send them an email confirmation message
  - Store their Gravatar URL
- If a User is created outside of the self-registration workflow
  - Auto-confirm them
  - Only store their Gravatar URL
- Once a user is confirmed (manually or automatically), allow them to access their user page, where they can see their gravatar image.
- Remind the user to confirm their email if they havenâ€™t done so after 24 hours
